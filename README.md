### Problem Statment
Netflix wants to better understand which movie they should produce next, including the most suitable actors and directors. We have a dataset containing movie budgets, box office performance, actors, directors, and genres. Your task is to build an Excel dashboard that provides insights into this dataset. The dashboard should help identify:
- The best-performing actors
- The top movies based on box office metrics
- Director performance
- Genre trends
- Seasonal patterns in movie performance
- Any additional insights that can guide future production decisions
  
The final dashboard should be clear, interactive, and visually compelling, enabling Netflix to make data-driven decisions.
### Data Source
Movie Data : The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Movie Data Homework.xlsx" file, containing detailed information about each movie's performance (box office and budget), actors, directors and genres.
